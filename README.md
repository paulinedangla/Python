# EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PYTHON LANGUAGE

This workbook concentrates all the lessons and exercises that I followed during my learning of the Python language :
- The UDEMY online course [100 Days of Code : The complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela Yu.
- [OPENCLASSROOMS online course on inferential statistics](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4525306-initiez-vous-a-la-statistique-inferentielle)

## OPENCLASSROOMS online course on inferential statistics

I took the introductory course in inferential statistics on Openclassroom in July 2022, given by a professor from ENSAE-ENSAI.

We study the plurality of responses given to strategic questions for the company. These answers are explained by decision support tools such as:
- Point estimate (Bernouilli's law or Normal law)
- Confidence interval
- Statistical test

The challenges of inferential statistics give rise to a probabilistic model.
