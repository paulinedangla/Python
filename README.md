## OPENCLASSROOMS online course on inferential statistics

I took the introductory course in inferential statistics on Openclassroom in July 2022, given by a professor from ENSAE-ENSAI.

We study the plurality of responses given to strategic questions for the company. These answers are explained by decision support tools such as:
- Point estimate (Bernouilli's law or Normal law)
- Confidence interval
- Statistical test

The challenges of inferential statistics give rise to a probabilistic model.

### Point estimate

It takes into account two sources of randomness:
- intrinsic variability
- variability due to sampling
  
The point estimate is represented by the proportion, mean and variance.

### Confidence interval

- on a proportion: binomial distribution for small samples or normal distribution for large samples
- on an average: Student's law
- on a variance: Chi-square law

### Statistical test (same laws as the confidence interval)

Hypotheses :
- working hypotheses: h0 (null hypothesis) and h1 (alternative hypothesis)
- critical region: h0 rejection zone
- risks related to the decision: error of the first kind or error of the second kind
- p-value
